// Destruction of SharedGroup (and hence Group and Table) is currently not thread-safe with respect to destruction of
// other accessors, you have to ensure mutual exclusion. This is also illustrated by the use of locks in the test
// test_destructor_thread_safety.cpp. Explicit call of SharedGroup::close() or Table::detach() is also not thread-safe
// with respect to destruction of other accessors.
