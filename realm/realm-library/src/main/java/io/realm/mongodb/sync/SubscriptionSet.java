/**
 * A subscription set is an immutable view of all current {@link Subscription}s for a given
 * Realm that has been configured for flexible sync.
 * <p>
 * Flexible Sync is a way of defining which data gets synchronized to and from the device using
 * {@link RealmQuery}s. The query and its metadata are represented by a {@link Subscription}.
 * <p>
 * A subscription set thus defines all the data that is available to the device and being
 * synchronized with the server. If the subscription set encounters an error, e.g. by containing an
 * invalid query, the entire subscription set will enter an {@link SubscriptionSet.State#ERROR}
 * state, and no synchronization will happen until the error has been fixed.
 * <p>
 * If a subscription is removed, so is the corresponding data, but it is only removed from the
 * device. It isn't deleted on the server.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to modify a subscription set while offline, but modification isn't
 * accepted by the server before {@link #getState()} returns {@link SubscriptionSet.State#COMPLETE}.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to force the subscription set to be synchronized with the server by using
 * {@link #waitForSynchronization()} and its variants.
