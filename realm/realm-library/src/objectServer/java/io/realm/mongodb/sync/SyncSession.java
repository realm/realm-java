/**
 * A session controls how data is synchronized between a single Realm on the device and the server
 * Realm on the Realm Object Server.
 * <p>
 * A Session is created by opening a Realm instance using a {@link SyncConfiguration}. Once a session has been created,
 * it will continue to exist until the app is closed or all threads using this {@link SyncConfiguration} closes their respective {@link Realm}s.
 * <p>
 * A session is controlled by Realm, but can provide additional information in case of errors.
 * These errors are passed along in the {@link SyncSession.ErrorHandler}.
 * <p>
 * When creating a session, Realm will establish a connection to the server. This connection is
 * controlled by Realm and might be shared between multiple sessions. It is possible to get insight
 * into the connection using {@link #addConnectionChangeListener(ConnectionListener)} and {@link #isConnected()}.
 * <p>
 * The session itself has a different lifecycle than the underlying connection. The state of the session
 * can be found using {@link #getState()}.
 * <p>
 * The {@link SyncSession} object is thread safe.

     * to be restored from a backup or because it has been too long since the client connected to the
     * server so the server has rotated the logs.
     * <p>
     * The Client Reset thus occurs because the server does not have the full information required to
     * bring the Client fully up to date.
     * <p>
     * The reset process is as follows: the local copy of the Realm is copied into a recovery directory
     * for safekeeping, and then deleted from the original location. The next time the Realm for that
     * URL is opened, the Realm will automatically be re-downloaded from MongoDB Realm, and
     * can be used as normal.
     * <p>
     * Data written to the Realm after the local copy of the Realm diverged from the backup remote copy
     * will be present in the local recovery copy of the Realm file. The re-downloaded Realm will
     * initially contain only the data present at the time the Realm was backed up on the server.
     * <p>
     * The client reset process can be initiated in one of two ways:
     * <ol>
     *     <li>
     *         Run {@link ClientResetRequiredError#executeClientReset()} manually. All Realm instances must be
     *         closed before this method is called.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         If Client Reset isn't executed manually, it will automatically be carried out the next time all
     *         Realm instances have been closed and re-opened. This will most likely be
     *         when the app is restarted.
     *     </li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * <b>WARNING:</b>
     * Any writes to the Realm file between this callback and Client Reset has been executed, will not be
     * synchronized to MongoDB Realm. Those changes will only be present in the backed up file. It is therefore
     * recommended to close all open Realm instances as soon as possible.
