 * than the one that created them.

/**
 * Checks if the query used to find this RealmObject has completed.
 *
 * Async methods like [io.realm.RealmQuery.findFirstAsync] return an RealmObject that represents the future result
 * of the RealmQuery. It can be considered similar to a [java.util.concurrent.Future] in this regard.
 *
 * Once `isLoaded()` returns `true`, the object represents the query result even if the query
 * didn't find any object matching the query parameters. In this case the RealmObject will
 * become a `null` object.
 *
 * "Null" objects represents `null`.  An exception is thrown if any accessor is called, so it is important to also
 * check isValid before calling any methods. A common pattern is:
 *
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val person = realm.where<Person>().findFirstAsync()
 * person.isLoaded() // == false
 * person.addChangeListener { p ->
 *     p.isLoaded() // always true here
 *     if(p.isValid()) {
 *         // It is safe to access this person.
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * Synchronous RealmObjects are by definition blocking hence this method will always return `true` for them.
 * This method will return `true` if called on an unmanaged object (created outside of Realm).
 *
 * @return `true` if the query has completed, `false` if the query is in
 * progress.
 * @see [isValid]
