 * didn't find any object matching the query parameters. In this case the RealmObject will
 * become a `null` object.

 * check isValid before calling any methods. A common pattern is:

 * ```kotlin
 * val person = realm.where<Person>().findFirstAsync()
 * person.isLoaded() // == false
 * person.addChangeListener { p ->
 *     p.isLoaded() // always true here

 * progress.
