/**
 * Using RealmChangeListener, it is possible to be notified when a Realm instance has been updated.
 * <p/>
 * Realm instances on a thread without an {@link android.os.Looper} (almost all background threads) don't get updated
 * automatically, but have to call {@link Realm#refresh()} manually. This will in turn trigger the RealmChangeListener
 * for that background thread.
 * <p/>
 * All {@link io.realm.RealmObject} and {@link io.realm.RealmResults} will automatically contain their new values when
 * the {@link #onChange()} method is called. Normally this means that it isn't necessary to query again for those
 * objects, but just invalidate any UI elements that are using them. If there is a chance that a object has been been
 * deleted, it can be verified by using {@link RealmObject#isValid()}.
 *
 * @see Realm#addChangeListener(RealmChangeListener)
