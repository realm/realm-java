/**
 * This class wraps access to a given Realm file on a single thread including its {@link SharedGroup}
 * and {@link ImplicitTransaction}. By nature this means that this class is not thread safe and
 * should only be used from the thread that created it.
 *
 * Realm files are using a MVCC scheme (Multiversion concurrency control), which means that multiple
 * versions of the data might exist in the same file. By default the file is always opened on the
 * latest version and it is possible to advance to the latest version by calling
 * {@link #advanceRead()}.
 *
 * Realm file access is a bit tricky as Realm must create a new reference to the file from each
 * thread. This means that any code that wants to manipulate the Realm file itself must use the
 * static methods in this class to ensure that it is safe to do so.
