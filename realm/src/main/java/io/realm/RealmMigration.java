/**
 * The RealmMigration class is used to describe the migration of one Realm schema to another.
 * The schema for a Realm is defined by all classes in a project that extend
 * {@link io.realm.RealmObject}, so any changes to these classes will require a migration.
 *
 * To support migrations from any previous schemaVersion to the newest, the following pattern is
 * recommended when writing a migration:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class CustomMigration implements RealmMigration {
 *   \@Override
 *   public long execute(DynamicRealm realm, long oldVersion, long newVersion) {
 *
 *     if (oldVersion == 0) {
 *       // Migrate from v0 to v1
 *       oldVersion++;
 *     }
 *
 *     if (oldVersion == 1) {
 *       // Migrate from v1 to v2
 *       oldVersion++;
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * During development when model classes can change frequently, it is possible to use
 * {@link io.realm.Realm#deleteRealm(RealmConfiguration)}. This will delete the database
 * file and eliminate the need for any migrations.
 *
 * @see io.realm.RealmConfiguration.Builder#schemaVersion(int)
 * @see io.realm.RealmConfiguration.Builder#migration(RealmMigration)
 * @see io.realm.RealmConfiguration.Builder#deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded()
 */

     * This method will be called if a migration is needed. The entire method is wrapped in a

     * @param realm The Realm schema on which to perform the migration.
