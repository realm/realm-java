/**
 * The RealmMigration class is used to describe the migration of one Realm schema to another. The schema for a Realm is
 * defined by all classes in a project that extend {@link io.realm.RealmObject}, so any changes to these classes will
 * require a migration.
 * <p/>
 * To support migrations from any previous schemaVersion to the newest, the following pattern is recommended when
 * writing a migration:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * public class CustomMigration implements RealmMigration {
 *   \@Override
 *   public long execute(Realm realm, long schemaVersion) {
 *     if (schemaVersion == 0) {
 *       // Migrate from v0 to v1
 *       schemaVersion++;
 *     }
 *
 *     if (schemaVersion == 0) {
 *       // Migrate from v0 to v1
 *       schemaVersion++;
 *     }
 *
 *     return schemaVersion;
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * During development when model classes can change frequently, it is possible to use {@link
 * io.realm.Realm#deleteRealmFile(android.content.Context)}. This will delete the database file and eliminate the need
 * for any migrations.
 *
 * @see Realm#migrateRealmAtPath(String, byte[], RealmMigration)
 * @see Realm#migrateRealmAtPath(String, RealmMigration)
