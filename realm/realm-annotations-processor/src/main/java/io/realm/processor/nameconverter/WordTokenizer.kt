/**
 * Segments a Java variable name into component words.
 *
 * Java variable names must follow the rules described in:
 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.8
 *
 * In this implementation we treat word separators as any of the following:
 *
 *  1. Anytime a `_` or `$` is encountered.
 *     Example is "_FooBar" or "_Foo$Bar" which both becomes "Foo" and "Bar".
 *
 *  2. Anytime you switch from a lower case character to an upper case character as identified by a
 *     `Character.isUpperCase(codepoint)` and `Character.isLowerCase(codepoint)`.
 *     Example is "FooBar" which becomes "Foo" and "Bar".
 *
 *  3. Anytime you switch from more than one uppercase character to a lower case one. As identified
 *     by `Character.isUpperCase(codepoint)` and `Character.isLowerCase(codepoint)`.
 *     Example is "FOOBar" which becomes "FOO" and "Bar.
 *
 *  4. Some characters like emojiis are neither uppercase or lowercase characters, so they will
 *     not trigger any of the above rules.
 *     Examples are "myüòÅ" and "MYüòÅ" which are both treated as one word.
 *
 *  5. Hungarian notation, i.e. strings starting with lowercase "m" followed by uppercase letter
 *     is stripped and not considered part of any word.
