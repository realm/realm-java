SUMMARY    : Write transactions
DESCR      : >
             Write transactions are created from {@link class_shared_group} objects with <code>startWrite()</code>.
             A WriteTransaction object extends {@link class_group} with two methods to commit or rollback
             changes.
             
             During the write transaction, you will have exclusive access to make changes to the group.
             Any other processes which tries to initiate a write transaction, will be stalled until your
             transaction ends with either commit() or rollback().
