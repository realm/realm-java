## Evolution Process <a name="evolution"></a>

Since Realm is a complex project and a new feature chosen by us could require an in depth analysis of Realm's core (written in C++) and a excelent knowledge of Realm's API architecture. That would be very hard to do, mainly because of our time to implement that feature is limited(two weeks). Therefore, we decided that the best step to take was search for [issues](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AT%3AEnhancement) with Enhancement labels. By doing this, we knew that the feature was already requested and necessary to the project, and ultimately our implementation, despite of being accepted or not, it's a good effort to contribute something useful for the users. 

So, after an extensive analysis, the issue selected was [#3752](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/3752).
