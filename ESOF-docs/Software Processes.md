# Analysis of the software developing process of Realm

## Introduction

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables. However at the moment, it currently runs only on Android.

The data is directly exposed as objects and queryable by code, removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues. In addition, the API has very few classes so that most of our users can pick it up intuitively, which, in turn allows getting simple apps up and running in minutes.

Realm also supports easy thread-safety, relationships and encryption. Another feature is that this database has proven to be faster than even raw SQLite on common operations, while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.

## Development process
