# About Realm

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables. This repository holds the source code for the 
Java version of Realm, which currently runs only on Android.

##Features

- **Mobile-first**: Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets and wearables.
- **Simple**: Data is directly exposed as objects and queryable by code, removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance
issues. Plus, we've worked hard to keep our API down to very few classes: most of our users pick it up intuitively, getting simple apps up & running in minutes.
- **Modern**: Realm supports easy thread-safety, relationships & encryption.
- **Fast**: Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations, while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.
