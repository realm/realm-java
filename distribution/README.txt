Realm for Android Beta 1
=================================

This is an early beta of Realm for Android. It will give you an idea of where we’re headed
and you can play a little with it, but we don’t recommend you use it in production yet.

We need your feedback to make it into something awesome!

Please follow the instructions at http://realm.io/docs/android/beta1/
and send your feedback to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/realm-java

Thanks!
The Realm team
