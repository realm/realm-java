Realm for Android
=================
This is a beta release of Realm for Android.

Getting Started
---------------
Please check the documentation on http://realm.io/docs/java for how to get started.

Examples
--------
Included in this distribution are a couple of examples.
You can try them out from Android Studio through "File->Import Project" and selecting the
build.gradle file in the respective example. Then click "Run".
But more importantly check out the source code in RealmIntroExample/app/src which will give examples
for how to use the API.

For the RealmGridViewExample, we have experienced a bug i GSON which means that for some devices
the example doesn't work.

Feedback
--------
We highly appreciate your feedback to make Realm  awesome!

Thanks!
The Realm team
