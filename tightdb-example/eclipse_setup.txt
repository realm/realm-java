Instructions for setting up TightDB for a new or existing project using Eclipse
===============================================================================

1. Create a new or open an existing project in Eclipse.
 
2. Copy the native TightDB library to the project's "lib" folder (<project>/lib).
- Note: create the "lib" folder if it doesn't exist in the project root.

3. Copy tightdb.jar and tightdb.jar to the project's "lib" folder (<project>/lib/tightdb.jar).

4. Add tightdb.jar to the build path (right-click on it -> Add to build path).

5. Make sure a Java compiler is configured with 1.6 or 1.7 version. 
- Right-click on the project -> Properties -> Java compiler.
- Make sure a the configured compiler version is at least 1.6.

6. Configure tightdb-devkit.jar as annotation processor (to be used for automatic code generation).
- Right-click on the project -> Properties
- Go to Java Compiler -> Annotation processing and enable annotation processing (check all the 3 check-boxes).  
- In Java Compiler -> Annotation processing configure the output folder for the generated sources in the "Generated source directory" field.
- Go to Java Compiler -> Annotation processing -> Factory Path, add tightdb-devkit.jar (click on Add JARs) and make sure it is checked.  

7. If the previous step was done properly, Eclipse will start generating Java source code as soon as you annotate your schema specification classes with the @Table annotation.
