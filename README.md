Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
This repository holds the source code for the Java version of Realm, which currently runs only on Android.

## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets and wearables.
* **Simple:** Data is directly exposed as objects and queryable by code, removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues. Plus, we've worked hard to [keep our API down to very few classes](http://realm.io/docs/java/): most of our users pick it up intuitively, getting simple apps up & running in minutes.
* **Modern:** Realm supports easy thread-safety, relationships & encryption.
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations, while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.

## Getting Started

Please see the [detailed instructions in our docs](http://realm.io/docs/java/#installation) to add Realm to your project.

## Using Snapshots

If you want to test recent bugfixes or features that have not been packaged in an official release yet, you can use a **-SNAPSHOT** release of the current development version of Realm via Gradle, available on [OJO](http://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local/io/realm/realm-android/)

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url 'http://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local'
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "io.realm:gradle-plugin:<version>-SNAPSHOT"
    }
}

repositories {
    maven {
        url 'http://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local'
    }
}
```

See [version.txt](version.txt) for the latest version number.

## Building Realm

In case you don't want to use the precompiled version, you can build Realm yourself from source.

Prerequisites:

 * Make sure `make` is available in your `$PATH`
 * Download the [**JDK 7**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) or [**JDK 8**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) from Oracle and install it.
 * Download & install the Android SDK, **Android 4.4.2 (API 19)**, **Android 4.4W (API 20)** and **Android 5.0 (API 21)** (for example through Android Studio’s **Android SDK Manager**)
 * Download the **Android NDK (= r10d)** for [OS X](http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r10d-darwin-x86_64.bin) or [Linux](http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r10d-linux-x86_64.bin).
 * Or you can use [Hombrew-versions](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions) to install Android NDK for Mac:

    ```
    brew tap homebrew/versions
    brew install android-ndk-r10d
    ```

 * Add two environment variables to your profile:

    ```
    export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
    export NDK_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/android-ndk-r10d/r10d
    ```

 * If you are using OS X, you'd be better to add following lines to `~/.profile` in order for Android Studio to see those environment variables.

    ```
    launchctl setenv ANDROID_HOME "$ANDROID_HOME"
    launchctl setenv NDK_HOME "$NDK_HOME"
    ```

Once you have completed all the pre-requisites building Realm is done with a simple command

```
./gradlew assemble
```

That command will generate:

 * a jar file for the Realm Gradle plugin
 * an aar file for the Realm library
 * a jar file for the annotations
 * a jar file for the annotations processor

### Other Commands

 * `./gradlew tasks` will show all the available tasks
 * `./gradlew javadoc` will generate the Javadocs
 * `./gradlew monkeyExamples` will run the monkey tests on all the examples
 * `./gradlew installRealmJava` will install the Realm library and plugin to mavenLocal()

Generating the Javadoc using the command above will report a large number of warnings. The Javadoc is generated, and we will fix the issue in the near future.

### Gotchas

The repository is organized in four Gradle projects:

 * `realm`: it contains the actual library (including the JNI layer), the annotations and the annotations processor.
 * `gradle-plugin`: it contains the Gradle plugin.
 * `examples`: it contains the example projects. This project directly depends on `gradle-plugin` which adds a dependency to the artifacts produced by `realm`.
 * The root folder is another Gradle project and all it does is orchestrating the other jobs

This means that `./gradlew clean` and `./gradlew cleanExamples` will fail if `assembleExamples` has not been executed first.
Note that IntelliJ [does not support multiple projects in the same window](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEABKL-6118#)
so each sub-project must be opened in its own window.
