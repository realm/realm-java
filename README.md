![Realm](logo.png)

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
This repository holds the source code for the Java version of Realm, which currently runs only on Android.

## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets and wearables.
* **Simple:** Data is directly exposed as objects and queryable by code, removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues. Plus, we've worked hard to [keep our API down to very few classes](https://realm.io/docs/java/): most of our users pick it up intuitively, getting simple apps up & running in minutes.
* **Modern:** Realm supports easy thread-safety, relationships & encryption.
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations, while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.

## Getting Started

## Using Snapshots

If you want to test recent bugfixes or features that have not been packaged in an official release yet, you can use a **-SNAPSHOT** release of the current development version of Realm via Gradle, available on [OJO](http://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local/io/realm/realm-android/)

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url 'http://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local'
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "io.realm:realm-gradle-plugin:<version>-SNAPSHOT"
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url 'http://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local'
        }
    }
}
```

See [version.txt](version.txt) for the latest version number.

## Building Realm

In case you don't want to use the precompiled version, you can build Realm yourself from source.

### Prerequisites

 * Download the [**JDK 7**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) or [**JDK 8**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) from Oracle and install it.
 * Download & install the Android SDK **Build-Tools 25.0.3**, **Android N (API 25)** (for example through Android Studio’s **Android SDK Manager**).
 * Install CMake from SDK manager in Android Studio ("SDK Tools" -> "CMake").

 * Realm currently requires version r10e of the NDK.  Download the one appropriate for your development platform, from the NDK [archive](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older_releases.html).
You may unzip the file wherever you choose.  For OSX, a suggested location is `~/Library/Android`.  The download will unzip as the directory `android-ndk-r10e`.

 * If you will be building with Android Studio, you will need to tell it to use the correct NDK.  To do this, define the variable `ndk.dir` in `realm/local.properties` and assign it the full path name of the directory that you unzipped above.  Note that there is a `local.properites` in the root directory that is *not* the one that needs to be edited.

    ```
    ndk.dir=/Users/brian/Library/Android/android-ndk-r10e/r10e

    ```

 * Add two environment variables to your profile (presuming you installed the NDK in `~/Library/android-ndk-r10e`):

    ```
    export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
    export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=~/Library/Android/android-ndk-r10e
    ```

 * If you will be launching Android Studio from the OS X Finder, you should also run the following two commands:

    ```
    launchctl setenv ANDROID_HOME "$ANDROID_HOME"
    launchctl setenv ANDROID_NDK_HOME "$ANDROID_NDK_HOME"
    ```

 * If you'd like to specify the location in which to store the archives of Realm Core, define the `REALM_CORE_DOWNLOAD_DIR` environment variable. It enables you to keep Core's archive when executing `git clean -xfd`.

   ```
   export REALM_CORE_DOWNLOAD_DIR=~/.realmCore
   ```

   OS X users must also run the following command in order for Android Studio to see this environment variable..

   ```
   launchctl setenv REALM_CORE_DOWNLOAD_DIR "$REALM_CORE_DOWNLOAD_DIR"
   ```

It would be a good idea to add all of the symbol definitions (and their accompanying `launchctl` commands, if you are using OS X) to your `~/.profile` (or `~/.zprofile` if the login shell is `zsh`)


### Download sources

You can download the source code of Realm Java by using git. Since realm-java has git submodules, use `--recursive` when cloning the repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:realm/realm-java.git --recursive
```

or

```
git clone https://github.com/realm/realm-java.git --recursive
```

### Build

Once you have completed all the pre-requisites building Realm is done with a simple command

```
./gradlew assemble
```

That command will generate:

 * a jar file for the Realm Gradle plugin
 * an aar file for the Realm library
 * a jar file for the annotations
 * a jar file for the annotations processor

The full build may take an hour or more, to complete.

### Other Commands

 * `./gradlew tasks` will show all the available tasks
 * `./gradlew javadoc` will generate the Javadocs
 * `./gradlew monkeyExamples` will run the monkey tests on all the examples
 * `./gradlew installRealmJava` will install the Realm library and plugin to mavenLocal()
 * `./gradlew clean -PdontCleanJniFiles` will remove all generated files except for JNI related files. This reduces recompilation time a lot.
 * `./gradlew connectedUnitTests -PbuildTargetABIs=$(adb shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abi)` will build JNI files only for the ABI which corresponds to the connected device.  These tests require a running Object Server (see below)

Generating the Javadoc using the command above may generate warnings. The Javadoc is generated despite the warnings.

### Gotchas

The repository is organized in six Gradle projects:

 * `realm`: it contains the actual library (including the JNI layer) and the annotations processor.
 * `realm-annotations`: it contains the annotations defined by Realm.
 * `realm-transformer`: it contains the bytecode transformer.
 * `gradle-plugin`: it contains the Gradle plugin.
 * `examples`: it contains the example projects. This project directly depends on `gradle-plugin` which adds a dependency to the artifacts produced by `realm`.
 * The root folder is another Gradle project.  All it does is orchestrate the other jobs

This means that `./gradlew clean` and `./gradlew cleanExamples` will fail if `assembleExamples` has not been executed first.
Note that IntelliJ [does not support multiple projects in the same window](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEABKL-6118#)
so each of the six Gradle projects must be imported as a separate IntelliJ project.

Since the repository contains several completely independent Gradle projects, several independent builds are run to assemble it.
Seeing a line like: `:realm:realm-library:compileBaseDebugAndroidTestSources UP-TO-DATE` in the build log does *not* imply
that you can run `./gradlew :realm:realm-library:compileBaseDebugAndroidTestSources`.

## Examples

The `./examples` folder contain a number of example projects showing how Realm can be used. If this is the first time you checkout or pull a new version of this repository to try the examples, you must call `./gradlew installRealmJava` from the top-level directory first. Otherwise the examples will not compile as they depend on all Realm artifacts being installed in `mavenLocal()`.

Standalone examples can be [downloaded from website](https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/#getting-started).

## Running Tests on a Device

To run these tests you must have a device connected to the build computer and the `adb` command must be in your `PATH`

1. Connect an Android device and verify that that the command `adb devices` shows a connected device:

	```sh
	adb devices
	List of devices attached
	004c03eb5615429f device
	```
   
2. Run instrumentation tests:

	```sh
	cd realm
	./gradlew connectedBaseDebugAndroidTest
	```

These tests may take as much as half an hour to complete.

## Running Tests Using The Realm Object Server

Tests in `realm/realm-library/src/syncIntegrationTest` require a running testing server to work.
A docker image can be built from `tools/sync_test_server/Dockerfile` to run the test server.
`tools/sync_test_server/start_server.sh` will build the docker image automatically.

To run a testing server locally:

1. Install [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview).

2. Run `tools/sync_test_server/start_server.sh`:

    ```sh
    cd tools/sync_test_server
    ./start_server.sh
    ```

    This command will not complete until the server has stopped.

3. Run instrumentation tests

	In a new terminal window, run:

	```sh
	cd realm
	./gradlew connectedObjectServerDebugAndroidTest
	```

Note that if using VirtualBox (Genymotion), the network needs to be bridged for the tests to work.
This is done in `VirtualBox > Network`. Set "Adapter 2" to "Bridged Adapter".

These tests may take as much as half an hour to complete.
