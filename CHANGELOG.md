## 3.1.0 (2017-04-05)

### Breaking Changes

* Updated file format of Realm files. Existing Realm files will automatically be migrated to the new format when they are opened, but older versions of Realm cannot open these files.
* [ObjectServer] Due to file format changes, Realm Object Server 1.3.0 or later is required.

### Enhancements

* Added support for reverse relationships through the `@LinkingObjects` annotation. See `io.realm.annotations.LinkingObjects` for documentation.  
  * This feature is in `@Beta`.
  * Queries on linking objects do not work.  Queries like `where(...).equalTo("field.linkingObjects.id", 7).findAll()` are not yet supported.
  * Backlink verification is incomplete.  Evil code can cause native crashes.
* The listener on `RealmObject` will only be triggered if the object changes (#3894).

* [ObjectServer] Changing the log level after starting a session now works correctly (#4337).

### Internal

* Using the Object Store's Session and SyncManager.
* Upgraded to Realm Sync 1.5.0.
* Upgraded to Realm Core 2.5.1.
* Upgraded Gradle to 3.4.1

## 3.0.0 (2017-02-28)

### Breaking Changes

* `RealmResults.distinct()` returns a new `RealmResults` object instead of filtering on the original object (#2947).
* `RealmResults` is auto-updated continuously. Any transaction on the current thread which may have an impact on the order or elements of the `RealmResults` will change the `RealmResults` immediately instead of change it in the next event loop. The standard `RealmResults.iterator()` will continue to work as normal, which means that you can still delete or modify elements without impacting the iterator. The same is not true for simple for-loops. In some cases a simple for-loop will not work (https://realm.io/docs/java/3.0.0/api/io/realm/OrderedRealmCollection.html#loops), and you must use the new createSnapshot() method.
* `RealmChangeListener` on `RealmObject` will now also be triggered when the object is deleted. Use `RealmObject.isValid()` to check this state(#3138).
* `RealmObject.asObservable()` will now emit the object when it is deleted. Use `RealmObject.isValid()` to check this state (#3138).
* Removed deprecated classes `Logger` and `AndroidLogger` (#4050).

### Deprecated

* `RealmResults.removeChangeListeners()`. Use `RealmResults.removeAllChangeListeners()` instead.
* `RealmObject.removeChangeListeners()`. Use `RealmObject.removeAllChangeListeners()` instead.
* `RealmResults.distinct()` and `RealmResults.distinctAsync()`. Use `RealmQuery.distinct()` and `RealmQuery.distinctAsync()` instead.

### Enhancements

* Added support for sorting by link's field (#672).
* Added `OrderedRealmCollectionSnapshot` class and `OrderedRealmCollection.createSnapshot()` method. `OrderedRealmCollectionSnapshot` is useful when changing `RealmResults` or `RealmList` in simple loops.
* Added `OrderedRealmCollectionChangeListener` interface for supporting fine-grained collection notifications.
* Added support for ChangeListeners on `RealmList`.
* Added `RealmList.asObservable()`.

### Bug Fixes

* Element type checking in `DynamicRealmObject#setList()` (#4252).
* Now throws `IllegalStateException` instead of process crash when any of thread confined methods in `RealmQuery` is called from wrong thread (#4228).
* Now throws `IllegalStateException` when any of thread confined methods in `DynamicRealmObject` is called from wrong thread (#4258).

### Internal

* Use Object Store's `Results` as the backend for `RealmResults` (#3372).
  - Use Object Store's notification mechanism to trigger listeners.
  - Local commits triggers Realm global listener and `RealmObject` listener on current thread immediately instead of in the next event loop.


## 2.3.2 (2017-02-27)

### Bug fixes

* Log levels in JNI layer were all reported as "Error" (#4204).
* Encrypted realms can end up corrupted if many threads are reading and writing at the same time (#4128).
* "Read-only file system" exception when compacting Realm file on external storage (#4140).

* NPE problem in SharedRealm.finalize() (#3730).
* `RealmList.contains()` and `RealmResults.contains()` now correctly use custom `equals()` method on Realm model classes.
* Build error when the project is using Kotlin (#4087).
* Bug causing classes to be replaced by classes already in Gradle's classpath (#3568).
* NullPointerException when notifying a single object that it changed (#4086).


## 2.3.0 (2017-01-19)

### Object Server API Changes

* Realm Sync v1.0.0 has been released, and Realm Mobile Platform is no longer considered in beta.
* Breaking change: Location of Realm files are now placed in `getFilesDir()/<userIdentifier>` instead of `getFilesDir()/`.
  This is done in order to support shared Realms among users, while each user retaining their own local copy.
* Breaking change: `SyncUser.all()` now returns Map instead of List.
* Breaking change: Added a default `UserStore` saving users in a Realm file (`RealmFileUserStore`).
* Breaking change: Added multi-user support to `UserStore`. Added `get(String)` and `remove(String)`, removed `remove()` and renamed `get()` to `getCurrent()`.
* Breaking change: Changed the order of arguments to `SyncCredentials.custom()` to match iOS: token, provider, userInfo.
* Added support for `PermissionOffer` and `PermissionOfferResponse` to `SyncUser.getManagementRealm()`.
* Exceptions thrown in error handlers are ignored but logged (#3559).
* Removed unused public constants in `SyncConfiguration` (#4047).
* Fixed bug, preventing Sync client to renew the access token (#4038) (#4039).
* Now `SyncUser.logout()` properly revokes tokens (#3639).

### Bug fixes

* Fixed native memory leak setting the value of a primary key (#3993).
* Activated Realm's annotation processor on connectedTest when the project is using kapt (#4008).

### Internal

* Updated to Realm Sync v1.0.0.
* Added a Realm backup when receiving a Sync client reset message from the server.

## 2.2.2 (2017-01-16)

### Object Server API Changes (In Beta)

* Disabled `Realm.compactRealm()` when sync is enabled as it might corrupt the Realm (https://github.com/realm/realm-core/issues/2345).

### Bug fixes

* "operation not permitted" issue when creating Realm file on some devices' external storage (#3629).
* Crash on API 10 devices (#3726).
* `UnsatisfiedLinkError` caused by `pipe2` (#3945).
* Unrecoverable error with message "Try again" when the notification fifo is full (#3964).
* Realm migration wasn't triggered when the primary key definition was altered (#3966).
* Use phantom reference to solve the finalize time out issue (#2496).

### Enhancements

* All major public classes are now non-final. This is mostly a compromise to support Mockito. All protected fields/methods are still not considered part of the public API and can change without notice (#3869).
* All Realm instances share a single notification daemon thread.
* Fixed Java lint warnings with generated proxy classes (#2929).

### Internal

* Upgraded Realm Core to 2.3.0.
* Upgraded Realm Sync to 1.0.0-BETA-6.5.

## 2.2.1 (2016-11-12)

### Object Server API Changes (In Beta)

* Fixed `SyncConfiguration.toString()` so it now outputs a correct description instead of an empty string (#3787).

### Bug fixes

* Added version number to the native library, preventing ReLinker from accidentally loading old code (#3775).

### Bug fixes

* Kotlin projects no longer create the `RealmDefaultModule` if no Realm model classes are present (#3746).
* Remove `includedescriptorclasses` option from ProGuard rule file in order to support built-in shrinker of Android Gradle Plugin (#3714).
* Unexpected `RealmMigrationNeededException` was thrown when a field was added to synced Realm.

### Enhancements

* Added support for the `annotationProcessor` configuration provided by Android Gradle Plugin 2.2.0 or later. Realm plugin adds its annotation processor to the `annotationProcessor` configuration instead of `apt` configuration if it is available and the `com.neenbedankt.android-apt` plugin is not used. In Kotlin projects, `kapt` is used instead of the `annotationProcessor` configuration (#3026).

## 2.1.1 (2016-10-27)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug in `Realm.insert` and `Realm.insertOrUpdate` methods causing a `StackOverFlow` when you try to insert a cyclic graph of objects between Realms (#3732).

### Object Server API Changes (In Beta)

* Set default RxFactory to `SyncConfiguration`.

### Bug fixes

* ProGuard configuration introduced in 2.1.0 unexpectedly kept classes that did not have the @KeepMember annotation (#3689).

## 2.1.0 (2016-10-25)

### Breaking changes

* * `SecureUserStore` has been moved to its own GitHub repository: https://github.com/realm/realm-android-user-store
  See https://github.com/realm/realm-android-user-store/blob/master/README.md for further info on how to include it.


### Object Server API Changes (In Beta)

* Renamed `User` to `SyncUser`, `Credentials` to `SyncCredentials` and `Session` to `SyncSession` to align names with Cocoa.
* Removed `SyncManager.setLogLevel()`. Use `RealmLog.setLevel()` instead.
* `SyncUser.logout()` now correctly clears `SyncUser.currentUser()` (#3638).
* Missing ProGuard configuration for libraries used by Sync extension (#3596).
* Error handler was not called when sync session failed (#3597).
* Added `User.all()` that returns all known Realm Object Server users.
* Upgraded Realm Sync to 1.0.0-BETA-3.2

### Deprecated

* `Logger`. Use `RealmLogger` instead.
* `AndroidLogger`. The logger for Android is implemented in native code instead.

### Bug fixes

* The following were not kept by ProGuard: names of native methods not in the `io.realm.internal` package, names of classes used in method signature (#3596).
* Permission error when a database file was located on external storage (#3140).
* Memory leak when unsubscribing from a RealmResults/RealmObject RxJava Observable (#3552).

### Enhancements

* `Realm.compactRealm()` now works for encrypted Realms.
* Added `first(E defaultValue)` and `last(E defaultValue)` methods to `RealmList` and `RealmResult`. These methods will return the provided object instead of throwing an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if the list is empty.
* Reduce transformer logger verbosity (#3608).
* `RealmLog.setLevel(int)` for setting the log level across all loggers.

### Internal

* Upgraded Realm Core to 2.1.3

### Credits

* Thanks to Max Furman (@maxfurman) for adding support for `first()` and `last()` default values.

## 2.0.2 (2016-10-06)

This release is not protocol-compatible with previous versions of the Realm Mobile Platform. The base library is still fully compatible.

### Bug fixes

* Build error when using Java 7 (#3563).

### Internal

* Upgraded Realm Core to 2.1.0
* Upgraded Realm Sync to 1.0.0-BETA-2.0.

## 2.0.1 (2016-10-05)

### Bug fixes

* `android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE` broadcast caused `RuntimeException` if sync extension was disabled (#3505).
* `android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE` was not delivered on Android 7 devices.
* `distinctAsync` did not respect other query parameters (#3537).
* `ConcurrentModificationException` from Gradle when building an application (#3501).

### Internal

* Upgraded to Realm Core 2.0.1 / Realm Sync 1.3-BETA

## 2.0.0 (2016-09-27)

This release introduces support for the Realm Mobile Platform!
See <https://realm.io/news/introducing-realm-mobile-platform/> for an overview of these great new features.

### Breaking Changes

* Files written by Realm 2.0 cannot be read by 1.x or earlier versions. Old files can still be opened.
* It is now required to call `Realm.init(Context)` before calling any other Realm API.
* Removed `RealmConfiguration.Builder(Context)`, `RealmConfiguration.Builder(Context, File)` and `RealmConfiguration.Builder(File)` constructors.
* `isValid()` now always returns `true` instead of `false` for unmanaged `RealmObject` and `RealmList`. This puts it in line with the behaviour of the Cocoa and .NET API's (#3101).
* armeabi is not supported anymore.
* Added new `RealmFileException`.
  - `IncompatibleLockFileException` has been removed and replaced by `RealmFileException` with kind `INCOMPATIBLE_LOCK_FILE`.
  - `RealmIOExcpetion` has been removed and replaced by `RealmFileException`.
* `RealmConfiguration.Builder.assetFile(Context, String)` has been renamed to `RealmConfiguration.Builder.assetFile(String)`.
* Object with primary key is now required to define it when the object is created. This means that `Realm.createObject(Class<E>)` and `DynamicRealm.createObject(String)` now throws `RealmException` if they are used to create an object with a primary key field. Use `Realm.createObject(Class<E>, Object)` or `DynamicRealm.createObject(String, Object)` instead.
* Importing from JSON without the primary key field defined in the JSON object now throws `IllegalArgumentException`.
* Now `Realm.beginTransaction()`, `Realm.executeTransaction()` and `Realm.waitForChange()` throw `RealmMigrationNeededException` if a remote process introduces incompatible schema changes (#3409).
* The primary key value of an object can no longer be changed after the object was created. Instead a new object must be created and all fields copied over.
* Now `Realm.createObject(Class)` and `Realm.createObject(Class,Object)` take the values from the model's fields and default constructor. Creating objects through the `DynamicRealm` does not use these values (#777).
* When `Realm.create*FromJson()`s create a new `RealmObject`, now they take the default values defined by the field itself and its default constructor for those fields that are not defined in the JSON object.

### Enhancements

* Added `realmObject.isManaged()`, `RealmObject.isManaged(obj)` and `RealmCollection.isManaged()` (#3101).
* Added `RealmConfiguration.Builder.directory(File)`.
* `RealmLog` has been moved to the public API. It is now possible to control which events Realm emit to Logcat. See the `RealmLog` class for more details.
* Typed `RealmObject`s can now continue to access their fields properly even though the schema was changed while the Realm was open (#3409).
* A `RealmMigrationNeededException` will be thrown with a cause to show the detailed message when a migration is needed and the migration block is not in the `RealmConfiguration`.


### Bug fixes

* Fixed a lint error in proxy classes when the 'minSdkVersion' of user's project is smaller than 11 (#3356).
* Fixed a potential crash when there were lots of async queries waiting in the queue.
* Fixed a bug causing the Realm Transformer to not transform field access in the model's constructors (#3361).
* Fixed a bug causing a build failure when the Realm Transformer adds accessors to a model class that was already transformed in other project (#3469).
* Fixed a bug causing the `NullPointerException` when calling getters/setters in the model's constructors (#2536).

### Internal

* Moved JNI build to CMake.
* Updated Realm Core to 2.0.0.
* Updated ReLinker to 1.2.2.

## 1.2.0 (2016-08-19)

### Bug fixes

* Throw a proper exception when operating on a non-existing field with the dynamic API (#3292).
* `DynamicRealmObject.setList` should only accept `RealmList<DynamicRealmObject>` (#3280).
* `DynamicRealmObject.getX(fieldName)` now throws a proper exception instead of a native crash when called with a field name of the wrong type (#3294).
* Fixed a concurrency crash which might happen when `Realm.executeTransactionAsync()` tried to call `onSucess` after the Realm was closed.

### Enhancements

* Added `RealmQuery.in()` for a comparison against multiple values.
* Added byte array (`byte[]`) support to `RealmQuery`'s `equalTo` and `notEqualTo` methods.
* Optimized internal caching of schema classes (#3315).

### Internal

* Updated Realm Core to 1.5.1.
* Improved sorting speed.
* Completely removed the `OptionalAPITransformer`.

### Credits

* Thanks to Brenden Kromhout (@bkromhout) for adding binary array support to `equalTo` and `notEqualTo`.

## 1.1.1 (2016-07-01)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a wrong JNI method declaration which might cause "method not found" crash on some devices.
* Fixed a bug that `Error` in the background async thread is not forwarded to the caller thread.
* Fixed a crash when an empty `Collection` is passed to `insert()`/`insertOrUpdate()` (#3103).
* Fixed a bug that does not transfer the primary key when `RealmSchemaObject.setClassName()` is called to rename a class (#3118).
* Fixed bug in `Realm.insert` and `Realm.insertOrUpdate` methods causing a `RealmList` to be cleared when inserting a managed `RealmModel` (#3105).
* Fixed a concurrency allocation bug in storage engine which might lead to some random crashes.
* Bulk insertion now throws if it is not called in a transaction (#3173).
* The IllegalStateException thrown when accessing an empty RealmObject is now more meaningful (#3200).
* `insert()` now correctly throws an exception if two different objects have the same primary key (#3212).
* Blackberry Z10 throwing "Function not implemented" (#3178).
* Reduced the number of file descriptors used by Realm Core (#3197).
* Throw a proper `IllegalStateException` if a `RealmChangeListener` is used inside an IntentService (#2875).

### Enhancements

* The Realm Annotation processor no longer consumes the Realm annotations. Allowing other annotation processors to run.

### Internal

* Updated Realm Core to 1.4.2.
* Improved sorting speed.

## 1.1.0 (2016-06-30)

### Bug fixes

* A number of bug fixes in the storage engine related to memory management in rare cases when a Realm has been compacted.
* Disabled the optional API transformer since it has problems with DexGuard (#3022).
* `OnSuccess.OnSuccess()` might not be called with the correct Realm version for async transaction (#1893).
* Fixed a bug in `copyToRealm()` causing a cyclic dependency objects being duplicated.
* Fixed a build failure when model class has a conflicting name such as `Map`, `List`, `String`, ... (#3077).

### Enhancements

* Added `insert(RealmModel obj)`, `insertOrUpdate(RealmModel obj)`, `insert(Collection<RealmModel> collection)` and `insertOrUpdate(Collection<RealmModel> collection)` to perform batch inserts (#1684).
* Enhanced `Table.toString()` to show a PrimaryKey field details (#2903).
* Enabled ReLinker when loading a Realm from a custom path by adding a `RealmConfiguration.Builder(Context, File)` constructor (#2900).
* Changed `targetSdkVersion` of `realm-library` to 24.
* Logs warning if `DynamicRealm` is not closed when GC happens as it does for `Realm`.

### Deprecated

* `RealmConfiguration.Builder(File)`. Use `RealmConfiguration.Builder(Context, File)` instead.

### Internal

* Updated Realm Core to 1.2.0.

## 1.0.1 (2016-05-25)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a crash when calling `Table.toString()` in debugger (#2429).
* Fixed a race condition which would cause some `RealmResults` to not be properly updated inside a `RealmChangeListener`. This could result in crashes when accessing items from those results (#2926/#2951).
* Revised `RealmResults.isLoaded()` description (#2895).
* Fixed a bug that could cause Realm to lose track of primary key when using `RealmObjectSchema.removeField()` and `RealmObjectSchema.renameField()` (#2829/#2926).
* Fixed a bug that prevented some devices from finding async related JNI methods correctly.
* Updated ProGuard configuration in order not to depend on Android's default configuration (#2972).
* Fixed a race condition between Realms notifications and other UI events. This could e.g. cause ListView to crash (#2990).
* Fixed a bug that allowed both `RealmConfiguration.Builder.assetFile()`/`deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded()` to be configured at the same time, which leads to the asset file accidentally being deleted in migrations (#2933).
* Realm crashed outright when the same Realm file was opened in two processes. Realm will now optimistically retry opening for 1 second before throwing an Error (#2459).

### Enhancements

* Removes RxJava related APIs during bytecode transforming to make RealmObject plays well with reflection when rx.Observable doesn't exist.

## 1.0.0 (2016-05-25)

No changes since 0.91.1.

## 0.91.1 (2016-05-25)

* Updated Realm Core to 1.0.1.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug when opening a Realm causes a staled memory mapping. Symptoms are error messages like "Bad or incompatible history type", "File format version doesn't match", and "Encrypted interprocess sharing is currently unsupported".

## 0.91.0 (2016-05-20)

* Updated Realm Core to 1.0.0.

### Breaking changes

* Removed all `@Deprecated` methods.
* Calling `Realm.setAutoRefresh()` or `DynamicRealm.setAutoRefresh()` from non-Looper thread throws `IllegalStateException` even if the `autoRefresh` is false (#2820).

### Bug fixes

* Calling RealmResults.deleteAllFromRealm() might lead to native crash (#2759).
* The annotation processor now correctly reports an error if trying to reference interfaces in model classes (#2808).
* Added null check to `addChangeListener` and `removeChangeListener` in `Realm` and `DynamicRealm` (#2772).
* Calling `RealmObjectSchema.addPrimaryKey()` adds an index to the primary key field, and calling `RealmObjectSchema.removePrimaryKey()` removes the index from the field (#2832).
* Log files are not deleted when calling `Realm.deleteRealm()` (#2834).

### Enhancements

* Upgrading to OpenSSL 1.0.1t. From July 11, 2016, Google Play only accept apps using OpenSSL 1.0.1r or later (https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/6376725, #2749).
* Added support for automatically copying an initial database from assets using `RealmConfiguration.Builder.assetFile()`.
