## 10.0.0 (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Breaking Changes
* Removed all references and API's releated to permissions. These are now managed through MongoDB Realm. Read more [here](XXX).
* Removed Query Based Sync API's and Subscriptions. These API's are not initially supported by MongoDB Realm. They will be re-introduced in a future release. `SyncConfiguration.partionKey()` has been added as a replacement. Read more [here](XXX).  
* Destructive updates of a schema of a synced Realm will now consistently throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` instead of some methods throwing `IllegalArgumentException`. The affected methods are `RealmSchema.remove(String)`, `RealmSchema.rename(String, String)`, `RealmObjectSchema.setClassName(String)`, `RealmObjectSchema.removeField(String)`, `RealmObjectSchema.renameField(String, String)`, `RealmObjectSchema.removeIndex(String)`, `RealmObjectSchema.removePrimaryKey()`, `RealmObjectSchema.addPrimaryKey(String)` and `RealmObjectSchema.addField(String, Class<?>, FieldAttribute)` 

### Enhancements
* None.

### Fixed
* None.

### Compatibility
* TODO.

### Internal
* OKHttp was upgraded to 3.12.0 from 3.10.0.
* Updated Android Gradle Plugin to 3.6.1.
* Updated Gradle to 5.6.4 
* Updated Dokka to 0.10.1
* Updated Android Build Tools to 29.0.2.
* Updated compileSdkVersion to 29.

## 7.0.0(YYYY-MM-DD)

NOTE: This version bumps the Realm file format to version 10. It is not possible to downgrade version 9 or earlier. Files created with older versions of Realm will be automatically upgraded.

### Breaking Changes
* [ObjectServer] Removed deprecated method `SyncConfiguration.Builder.partialRealm()`. Use `SyncConfiguration.Builder.fullSynchronization()` instead.
* [ObjectServer] Removed deprecated methods `SyncConfiguration.automatic()` and `SyncConfiguration.automatic(User, Uri)`. Use `SyncUser.getDefaultConfiguration()` and `SyncUser.createConfiguration(Url)`.
* [ObjectServer] Removed deprecated method `ErrorCode.fromInt(int)`.
* [ObjectServer] Removed deprecated method `SyncCredentials.nickname(name)` and `SyncCredentials.nickname(name, isAdmin)`. Use `SyncCredentials.usernamePassword(username, password)` instead.
* [ObjectServer] Deprecated state `SyncSession.State.ERROR` has been removed. Use `SyncConfiguration.Builder.errorHandler(ErrorHandler)` instead.
* [ObjectServer] `IncompatibleSyncedFileException` is removed as it is no longer used.
* [ObjectServer] New error codes thrown by the underlying sync layers now have proper enum mappings in `ErrorCode.java`. A few other errors have been renamed in order to have consistent naming. (Issue [#6387](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6387)) 
* RxJava Flowables and Observables are now subscribed to and unsubscribed to asynchronously on the thread holding the live Realm, instead of previously where this was done synchronously.
* All RxJava Flowables and Observables now return frozen objects instead of live objects. This can be configured using `RealmConfiguration.Builder.rxFactory(new RealmObservableFactory(true|false))`. By using frozen objects, it is possible to send RealmObjects across threads, which means that all RxJava operators should now be supported without the need to copy Realm data into unmanaged objects.
* MIPS is not supported anymore.
* Realm now requires `minSdkVersion` 16. Up from 9.
* [ObjectServer] `IncompatibleSyncedFileException` is removed and no longer thrown.

### Enhancements
* Added support for `org.bson.types.Decimal128` and `org.bson.types.ObjectId` as supported fields in model classes.
* Add support for `org.bson.types.ObjectId` as a primary key.
* Added `Realm.freeze()`, `RealmObject.freeze()`, `RealmResults.freeze()` and `RealmList.freeze()`. These methods will return a frozen version of the current Realm data. This data can be read from any thread without throwing an `IllegalStateException`, but will never change. All frozen Realms and data can be closed by calling `Realm.close()` on the frozen Realm, but fully closing all live Realms will also close the frozen ones. Frozen data can be queried as normal, but trying to mutate it in any way will throw an `IllegalStateException`. This includes all methods that attempt to refresh or add change listeners. (Issue [#6590](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/pull/6590))
* Added `Realm.isFrozen()`, `RealmObject.isFrozen()`, `RealmObject.isFrozen(RealmModel)`, `RealmResults.isFrozen()` and `RealmList.isFrozen()`, which returns whether or not the data is frozen.
* Added `RealmConfiguration.Builder.maxNumberOfActiveVersions(long number)`. Setting this will cause Realm to throw an `IllegalStateException` if too many versions of the Realm data are live at the same time. Having too many versions can dramatically increase the filesize of the Realm.
* `RealmResults.asJSON()` is no longer `@Beta`.
* The default `toString()` for proxy objects now print the length of binary fields. (Issue [#6767](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/pull/6767))

### Fixes
* If a DynamicRealm and Realm was opened for the same file they would share transaction state by accident. The implication was that writes to a `Realm` would immediately show up in the `DynamicRealm`. This has been fixed, so now it is required to call `refresh()` on the other Realm or wait for normal change listeners to detect the change.

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.23.1 or later.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v10 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats from Realm Java 2.0 and later).
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm-java in the 6.x.y series.

### Internal
* `OsSharedRealm.VersionID.hashCode()` was not implemented correctly and included the memory location in the hashcode.
* OKHttp was upgraded to 3.10.0 from 3.9.0.
* The NDK has been upgraded from r10e to r21.
* The compiler used for C++ code has changed from GCC to Clang.
* OpenSSL used by Realms encryption layer has been upgraded from 1.0.2k to 1.1.1b.
* Updated to Object Store commit: 820b74e2378f111991877d43068a95d2b7a2e404.
* Updated to Realm Sync 5.0.3.
* Updated to Realm Core 6.0.4.

### Credits
* Thanks to @joxon for better support for binary fields in proxy objects.


## 6.1.0(2020-01-17)

### Fixed
* None.

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.23.1 or later.

* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm-java in the 6.x.y series.

### Internal
* None.



## 6.1.0(2020-01-17)

### Enhancements
* The Realm Gradle plugin now applies `kapt` when used in Kotlin Multiplatform projects. Note, Realm Java still only works for the Android part of a Kotlin Multiplatform project. (Issue [#6653](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6653))
* The error message shown when no native code could be found for the device is now much more descriptive. This is particular helpful if an app is using App Bundle or APK Split and the resulting APK was side-loaded outside the Google Play Store. (Issue [#6673](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6673))
* `RealmResults.asJson()` now encode binary data as Base64 and null object links are reported as `null` instead of `[]`.

### Fixed
* Fixed using `RealmList` with a primitive type sometimes crashing with `Destruction of mutex in use`. (Issue [#6689](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6689)) 
* `RealmObjectSchema.transform()` would crash if one of the `DynamicRealmObject` provided are deleted from the Realm. (Issue [#6657](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6657), since 0.86.0)
* The Realm Transformer will no longer attempt to send anonymous metrics when Gradle is invoked with `--offline`. (Issue [#6691](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6691))

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.23.1 or later.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

* Updated to Realm Sync 4.9.4.
* Updated to Realm Core 5.23.8.

### Credits
* Thanks to @sellmair (Sebastian Sellmair) for improving Kotlin Multiplatform support.


## 6.0.2(2019-11-21)

### Enhancements
* None.

### Fixed
* [ObjectServer] `SyncSession` progress listeners now work correctly in combination with `SyncConfiguration.waitForInitialRemoteData()`.
* The `@RealmModule` annotation would be stripped on an empty class when using R8 resulting in apps crashing on startup with `io.realm.DefaultRealmModule is not a RealmModule. Add @RealmModule to the class definition.`. ([#6449](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6449))

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.23.1 or later.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm-java in the 6.x.y series.

### Internal
* Updated to Object Store commit: ad96a4c334b475dd67d50c1ca419e257d7a21e18.
* Updated to Realm Sync v4.8.3.

## 6.0.1(2019-11-11)

NOTE: Anyone using encrypted Realms are strongly advised to upgrade to this version.

### Enhancements
* None

### Fixed
* When using encrypted Realms a race condition could lead to the Realm ending up corrupted when the file increased in size. This could manifest as a wide array of different error messages. Most commonly seen has been "Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV) from Java_io_realm_internal_UncheckedRow_nativeGetString", "RealmFileException: Top ref outside file" and "Unable to open a realm at path. ACCESS_ERROR: Invalid mnemonic". ([#6152](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6152), since 5.0.0)
* `RealmResults.asJSON()` now prints lists with primitive values directly instead of wrapping each value in an object with an `!ARRAY_VALUE` property.

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.23.1 or later.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm-java in the 6.x.y series.

### Internal
* Updated to Realm Sync 4.7.12.
* Updated to Realm Core 5.23.6.

### Credits
* Thanks to Vladimir Konkov (@vladimirfx) for help with isolating ([#6152](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6152)).


## 6.0.0(2019-10-01)

### Breaking Changes
* [ObjectServer] The `PermissionManager` is no longer backed by Realms but instead a REST API. This means that the `PermissionManager` class has been removed and all methods have been moved to `SyncUser`. Some method names have been renamed slightly and return values for methods have changed from `RealmResults<Permission>` to `List<Permission>`. This should only have an impact if change listeners were used to listen for changes. In these cases, you must now manually retry the request.

### Enhancements
None.

### Fixed
None.

### Compatibility

* [ObjectServer] Queries with nullable `Date`'s did not serialize correctly. Only relevant if using Query-based Synchronization. (Realm Core issue [#3388](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/pull/3388))
* [ObjectServer] Fixed crash with `java.lang.IllegalStateException: The following changes cannot be made in additive-only schema mode` when opening an old Realm created between Realm Java 5.10.0 and Realm Java 5.13.0. (Issue [#6619](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6619), since 5.13.0).

* None.

## 5.15.0(2019-09-05)

### Enhancements
* [ObjectServer] Added support for Client Resync for fully synchronized Realms which automatically will recover the local Realm in case the server is rolled back. This largely replaces the Client Reset mechanism. Can be configured using `SyncConfiguration.Builder.clientResyncMode()`. (Issue [#6487](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6487))

### Fixed
* Huawei devices reporting `Permission denied` when opening a Realm file after an app upgrade or factory reset. This does not automatically fix already existing Realm files. See [this FAQ entry](https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/#huawei-permission-denied) for more details. (Issue [#5715](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/5715))
* `Realm.copyToRealm()` and `Realm.insertOrUpdate()` crashed on model classes if `@LinkingObjects` was used to target a field with a re-defined internal name in the parent class (e.g. by using `@RealmField`). (Issue [#6581](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6581))

### Compatibility

* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm-java in the 5.x.y series.

### Internal
* Implemented direct access to sync workers on Cloud, bypassing the Sync Proxy: the binding will override the sync session's url prefix if the token refresh response for a realm contains a sync worker path field.
* Updated to Object Store commit: 9f19d79fde248ba37cef0bd52fe64984f9d71be0.
* Updated to Realm Sync 4.7.4.

### Fixed
* [ObjectServer] The C++ networking layer now correctly uses any system defined proxy the same way the Java networking layer does. (Issue [#6574](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/pull/6574)).
* The Realm bytecode transformer now works correctly with Android Gradle Plugin 3.6.0-alpha01 and beyond. (Issue [#6531](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6531)).

## 5.12.0(2019-06-20)

### Enhancements
* [ObjectServer] Added `SyncManager.refreshConnections()` that can be used to manually trigger a reconnect for all sessions. This is useful if the device has been offline for a long time or fail to detect that it regained connectivity. (Issue [#259](https://github.com/realm/realm-java-private/issues/259))
* Added `RealmResults.asJson()` in `@Beta` that returns the result of the query as a JSON payload (#6540).

### Fixed
* [ObjectServer] `PermissionManager` stopped working if an intermittent network error was reported. (Issue [#6492](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6492), since 3.7.0)
* The Kotlin extensions library no longer defines a `app_name`, which in some cases conflicted with the `app_name` defined by applications. (Issue [#6536](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6536), since 4.3.0)

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.21.0 or later.

## 5.11.0(2019-05-01)

NOTE: This version is only compatible with Realm Object Server 3.21.0 or later.

### Enhancements
* [ObjectServer] Added `RealmQuery.includeLinkingObjects()`. This is only relevant for Query-based Realms and tells subscriptions to include objects linked through `@LinkingObjects` fields as part of the subscription as well. Objects referenced through objects and lists are always included as a default. (Issue [#6426](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6426))
* Encryption now uses hardware optimized functions, which significantly improves the performance of encrypted Realms. ([Realm Core PR #3241](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/pull/3241))
* Improved query performance when using `RealmQuery.in()` queries. ([Realm Core PR #3250](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/pull/3250)).
* Improved query performance when querying Integer fields with indexes, e.g. primary key fields. ([Realm Core PR #3272](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/pull/3272)).
* Improved write performance when writing changes to disk ([Realm Core PR #2927](https://github.com/realm/realm-sync/issues/2927))
* Added support for incremental annotation processing added in Gradle 4.7. (Issue [#5906](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/5906)).

### Fixed
* [ObjectServer] Fix an error in the calculation of the `downloadableBytes` value sent by `ProgressListeners`.
* [ObjectServer] HTTP requests made by the Sync client now always include a Host: header, as required by HTTP/1.1, although its value will be empty if no value is specified by the application.
* [ObjectServer] The server no longer rejects subscriptions based on queries with distinct and/or limit clauses.
* [ObjectServer] If a user had `canCreate` but not `canUpdate` privileges on a class, the user would be able to create the object, but not actually set any meaningful values on that object, despite the rule that objects created within the same transaction can always be modified.
*  Native crash happening if bulk updating a field in a `RealmResult` would cause the object to no longer be part of the query result. (Issue [#6478](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6478), since 5.8.0).

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.21.0 or later.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm-java in the 5.x.y series.

### Internal
* Updated to Realm Core 5.19.1.
* Updated to Relm Sync 4.4.2.
* Updated to Object Store commit e4b1314d21b521fd604af7f1aacf3ca94272c19a


## 5.10.0(2019-03-22)

### Enhancements
* [ObjectServer] Added 4 new fields to query-based Subscriptions: `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `expiresAt` and `timeToLive`. These make it possible to better reason about and control current subscriptions. (Issue [#6453](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6453))
* [ObjectServer] Added the option of updating the query controlled by a Subscription using either `RealmQuery.findAllAsync(String name, boolean update)`,  `RealmQuery.subscribe(String name, boolean update)` or `Subscription.setQuery(RealmQuery query)`. (Issue [#6453](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6453))
* [ObjectServer] Added the option of setting a time-to-live for subscriptions. Setting this will automatically delete the subscription after the provided TTL has expired and the subscription hasn't been used. (Issue [#6453](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6453))

### Fixed
* Dates returned from the Realm file no longer overflow or underflow if they exceed `Long.MAX_VALUE` or `Long.MIN_VALUE` but instead clamp to their respective value. (Issue [#2722](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/2722))

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.11.0 or later.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats).
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm-java in the 5.x.y series.

### Internal
* Updated to Object Store commit: e9819ed9c77ed87b5d7bed416a76cd5bcf255802


## 5.9.1(2019-02-21)

### Enhancements
* None

### Fixed
* [ObjectServer] Reporting too many errors from the native layer resulted in a native crash with `local reference table overflow`. (Issue [#249](https://github.com/realm/realm-java-private/issues/249), since 5.9.0)

### Compatibility

### Internal
* None

## 5.9.0(2019-01-15)

### Enhancements
* [ObjectServer] Added `ObjectServerError.getErrorType()` and `ObjectServerError.getErrorType()` which returns the underlying native error information. This is especially relevant if `ObjectServerError.getErrorCode()` returns `UNKNOWN`. [#6364](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6364)
* Added better checks for detecting corrupted files, both before and after the file is written to disk.

### Fixed
* [ObjectServer] Native errors sometimes mapped to the wrong Java ErrorCode. (Issue [#6364](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6364), since 2.0.0)
* [ObjectServer] Query-based Sync queries involving LIMIT, limited the result before permissions were evaluated. This could sometimes result in the wrong number of elements being returned.
* Removed Java 8 bytecode. Resulted in errors like `D8: Invoke-customs are only supported starting with Android O (--min-api 26)` if not compiled with Java 8. (Issue [#6300](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6300), since 5.8.0).

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.11.0 or later.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm-java in the 5.x.y series.

### Internal
* Updated to Object Store commit: f964c2640f635e76839559cb703732e9e906ba4c
* Updated Realm Sync to 3.14.13
* Updated Realm Core to 5.12.7


## 5.8.0 (2018-11-06)

This release also contains all changes from 5.8.0-BETA1 and 5.8.0-BETA2.

### Enhancements
* [ObjectServer] Added Subscription class available to Query-based Realms. This exposes a Subscription more directly. This class is in beta. [#6231](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/pull/6231).
  * [ObjectServer] Added `Realm.getSubscriptions()`, `Realm.getSubscriptions(String pattern)` and `Realm.getSubscription` to make it easier to find existing subscriptions. These API's are in beta. [#6231](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/pull/6231)
  * [ObjectServer] Added `RealmQuery.subscribe()` and `RealmQuery.subscribe(String name)` to subscribe immediately inside a transaction. These API's are in beta. [#6231](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/pull/6231)
  * [ObjectServer] Added support for subscribing directly inside `SyncConfiguration.initialData()`. This can be coupled with `SyncConfiguration.waitForInitialRemoteData()` in order to block a Realm from opening until the initial subscriptions are ready and have downloaded data. This API are in beta. [#6231](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/pull/6231)
* [ObjectServer] Improved performance when merging changes from the server.
* [ObjectServer] Added support for timeouts when uploading or downloading data manually using `SyncSession.downloadAllServerChanges(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` and `SyncSession.uploadAllLocalChanges(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`. [#6073](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/pull/6073)
* [ObjectServer] Added support for timing out when downloading initial data for synchronized Realms using `SyncConfiguration.waitForInitialRemoteData(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`. [#6247](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6247)
* [ObjectServer] Added `Realm.init(Context, String)` which defines a custom User-Agent String sent to the Realm Object Server when a session is created. Using this requires Realm Object Server 3.12.4 or later. [#6267](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6267)
* Added support for `ImportFlag`s to `Realm.copyToRealm()` and `Realm.copyToRealmOrUpdate()`. This makes it possible to choose a mode so only fields that actually changed are written to disk. This improves notifications and Object Server performance. [#6224](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/pull/6224)
* Added support for bulk updating the same property in all objects that are part of a query result using `RealmResults.setValue(String fieldName, Object value)` or one of the specialized overrides that have been added for all supported types, e.g. `RealmResults.setString(String fieldName, String value)`. [#762](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/762)

### Enhancements
* None

### Fixed
* [ObjectServer] `RealmResults` listeners not triggering the initial callback for Query-based Realm when the device is offline. (Issue [#6235](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6235), since 5.0.0).

## 5.7.0 (2018-09-24)

### Enhancements
* [ObjectServer] Devices will now report download progress for read-only Realms which
  will allow the server to compact files sooner, saving server space. This does not affect
  the client. You will need to upgrade your Realm Object Server to at least version 3.11.0
  or use [Realm Cloud](https://cloud.realm.io). If you try to connect to a ROS v3.10.x or
  previous, you will see an error like `Wrong protocol version in Sync HTTP request,
  client protocol version = 25, server protocol version = 24`.

### Fixed
* None

  `ClassPermissions.findOrCreate(String roleName)` ([#6168](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6168)).
* `@RealmClass("name")` and `@RealmField("name")` can now be used as a shorthand for defining custom
  name mappings ([#6145](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/6145)).
* Added support for `RealmQuery.limit(long limit)` ([#544](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/544)).
  When building a `RealmQuery`, `sort()`, `distinct()` and `limit()` will now be applied in the order
  they are called. Before this release, `sort()`  and `distinct()` could be called any order, but
  `sort()` would always be applied before `distinct()`.

## 5.2.0 (2018-06-06)

The feature previously named Partial Sync is now called Query-Based Sync and is now the default mode when synchronizing Realms.
This has impacted a number of API's. See below for the details.

### Deprecated

* [ObjectServer] `SyncConfiguration.automatic()` has been deprecated in favour of `SyncUser.getDefaultConfiguration()`.
* [ObjectServer] `new SyncConfiguration.Builder(user, url)` has been deprecated in favour of `SyncUser.createConfiguration(url)`. NOTE: Creating configurations using `SyncUser` will default to using query-based Realms, while creating them using `new SyncConfiguration.Builder(user, url)` will default to fully synchronized Realms.
* [ObjectServer] With query-based sync being the default `SyncConfiguration.Builder.partialRealm()` has been deprecated. Use ``SyncConfiguration.Builder.fullSynchronization()` if you want full synchronisation instead.

### Enhancements

* [ObjectServer] Added `SyncUser.createConfiguration(url)`. Realms created this way are query-based Realms by default.
* [ObjectServer] Added `SyncUser.getDefaultConfiguration()`.
* The Realm bytecode transformer now supports incremental builds (#3034).
* Improved speed and allocations when parsing field descriptions in queries (#5547).

### Bug Fixes

* Having files that ends with `RealmProxy` will no longer break the Realm Transformer (#3709).

### Internal

* Module mediator classes being generated now produces a stable output enabling better support for incremental builds (#3034).


## 5.1.0 (2018-04-25)

### Enhancements

* [ObjectServer] Added support for `SyncUser.requestPasswordReset()`, `SyncUser.completePasswordReset()`
  and their async variants. This makes it possible to reset the password for users created using
  `Credentials.usernamePassword()` where they used their email as username (#5821).
* [ObjectServer] Added support for `SyncUser.requestEmailConfirmation()`, `SyncUser.confirmEmail()`
  and their async variants. This makes it possible to ask users to confirm their email. This is only
  supported for users created using `Credentials.usernamePassword()` who have used an email as their
  username (#5821).
* `RealmQuery.in()` now support `null` which will always return no matches (#4011).
* Added support for `RealmQuery.alwaysTrue()` and `RealmQuery.alwaysFalse()`.

### Bug Fixes

* Changing a primary key from being nullable to being required could result in objects being deleted (##5899).


## 5.0.1 (2018-04-09)

### Enhancements

* [ObjectServer] `SyncConfiguration.automatic()` will make use of the host port to work out the default Realm URL.
* [ObjectServer] A role is now automatically created for each user with that user as its only member. This simplifies the common use case of restricting access to specific objects to a single user. This role can be accessed at `PermissionUser.getRole()`.
* [ObjectServer] Expose `Role.getMembers()` to access the list of associated `UserPermission`.

### Bug Fixes

* `RealmList.move()` did not move items correctly for unmanaged lists (#5860).
* `RealmObject.isValid()` not correctly returns `false` if `null` is provided as an argument (#5865).
* `RealmQuery.findFirst()` and `RealmQuery.findFirstAsync()` not working correctly with sorting (#5714).

* The `OrderedCollectionChangeSet` parameter in `OrderedRealmCollectionChangeListener.onChange()` is no longer nullable. Use `changeSet.getState()` instead (#5619).
* `realm.subscribeForObjects()` have been removed. Use `RealmQuery.findAllAsync(String subscriptionName)` and `RealmQuery.findAllAsync()` instead.
* Removed previously deprecated `RealmQuery.findAllSorted()`, `RealmQuery.findAllSortedAsync()` `RealmQuery.distinct()` and `RealmQuery.distinctAsync()`.
* Renamed `RealmQuery.distinctValues()` to `RealmQuery.distinct()`

### Enhancements

* Projects using Kotlin now include additional extension functions that make working with Kotlin easier. See [docs](https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/#kotlin) for more info (#4684).
* New query predicate: `sort()`.
* New query predicate: `distinctValues()`. Will be renamed to `distinct` in next major version.
* The Realm annotation processor now has a stable output when there are no changes to model classes, improving support for incremental compilers (#5567).

* [ObjectServer] Added `SyncUser.allSessions` to retrieve the all valid sessions belonging to the user (#4783).
* Added `Nullable` annotation to methods that may return `null` in order to improve Kotlin usability. This also introduced a dependency to `com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305`.
* `org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull` is now an alias for `@Required`. This means that the Realm Schema now fully understand Kotlin non-null types.
* Added support for new data type `MutableRealmIntegers`. The new type behaves almost exactly as a reference to a Long (mutable nullable, etc) but supports `increment` and `decrement` methods, which implement a Conflict Free Replicated Data Type, whose value will converge even when changed across distributed devices with poor connections (#4266).
* Added more detailed exception message for `RealmMigrationNeeded`.
* Bumping schema version only without any actual schema changes will just succeed even when the migration block is not supplied. It threw an `RealmMigrationNeededException` before in the same case.
* Throw `IllegalStateException` when schema validation fails because of wrong declaration of `@LinkingObjects`.

### Bug Fixes

* Potential crash after using `Realm.getSchema()` to change the schema of a typed Realm. `Realm.getSchema()` now returns an immutable `RealmSchema` instance.
* `Realm.copyToRealmOrUpdate()` could cause a `RealmList` field to contain duplicated elements (#4957).
* `RealmSchema.create(String)` and `RealmObjectSchema.setClassName(String)` did not accept class name whose length was 51 to 57.
* Workaround for an Android JVM crash when using `compactOnLaunch()` (#4964).
* Class name in exception message from link query is wrong (#5096).
* The `compactOnLaunch` callback is no longer invoked if the Realm at that path is already open on other threads.

### Internal

* [ObjectServer] removed `ObjectServerUser` and its inner classes, in a step to reduce `SyncUser` complexity (#3741).
* [ObjectServer] changed the `SyncSessionStopPolicy` to `AfterChangesUploaded` to align with other binding and to prevent use cases where the Realm might be deleted before the last changes get synchronized (#5028).
* Upgraded Realm Sync to 1.10.8
* Let Object Store handle migration.

* Workaround for crashes on specific Samsung devices which are caused by a buggy `memmove` call (#3651).

## 3.1.0 (2017-04-05)

### Breaking Changes

* Updated file format of Realm files. Existing Realm files will automatically be migrated to the new format when they are opened, but older versions of Realm cannot open these files.
* [ObjectServer] Due to file format changes, Realm Object Server 1.3.0 or later is required.

### Enhancements

* Added support for reverse relationships through the `@LinkingObjects` annotation. See `io.realm.annotations.LinkingObjects` for documentation.  
  * This feature is in `@Beta`.
  * Queries on linking objects do not work.  Queries like `where(...).equalTo("field.linkingObjects.id", 7).findAll()` are not yet supported.
  * Backlink verification is incomplete.  Evil code can cause native crashes.
* The listener on `RealmObject` will only be triggered if the object changes (#3894).
* Added `RealmObjectChangeListener` interface that provide detailed information about `RealmObject` field changes.
* Listeners on `RealmList` and `RealmResults` will be triggered immediately when the transaction is committed on the same thread (#4245).
* The real `RealmMigrationNeededException` is now thrown instead of `IllegalArgumentException` if no migration is provided for a Realm that requires it.
* `RealmQuery.distinct()` can be performed on unindexed fields (#2285).
* `targetSdkVersion` is now 25.
* [ObjectServer] In case of a Client Reset, information about the location of the backed up Realm file is now reported through the `ErrorHandler` interface (#4080).
* [ObjectServer] Authentication URLs now automatically append `/auth` if no other path segment is set (#4370).

### Bug Fixes

* `Realm.migrateRealm(RealmConfiguration)` now fails correctly with an `IllegalArgumentException` if a `SyncConfiguration` is provided (#4075).
* Potential cause for Realm file corruptions (never reported).
* Add `@Override` annotation to proxy class accessors and stop using raw type in proxy classes in order to remove warnings from javac (#4329).
* `findFirstAsync()` now returns an invalid object if there is no object matches the query condition instead of running the query repeatedly until it can find one (#4352).
* [ObjectServer] Changing the log level after starting a session now works correctly (#4337).

### Internal

* Using the Object Store's Session and SyncManager.
* Upgraded to Realm Sync 1.5.0.
* Upgraded to Realm Core 2.5.1.
* Upgraded Gradle to 3.4.1

## 3.0.0 (2017-02-28)

### Breaking Changes

* `RealmResults.distinct()` returns a new `RealmResults` object instead of filtering on the original object (#2947).
* `RealmResults` is auto-updated continuously. Any transaction on the current thread which may have an impact on the order or elements of the `RealmResults` will change the `RealmResults` immediately instead of change it in the next event loop. The standard `RealmResults.iterator()` will continue to work as normal, which means that you can still delete or modify elements without impacting the iterator. The same is not true for simple for-loops. In some cases a simple for-loop will not work (https://realm.io/docs/java/3.0.0/api/io/realm/OrderedRealmCollection.html#loops), and you must use the new createSnapshot() method.
* `RealmChangeListener` on `RealmObject` will now also be triggered when the object is deleted. Use `RealmObject.isValid()` to check this state(#3138).
* `RealmObject.asObservable()` will now emit the object when it is deleted. Use `RealmObject.isValid()` to check this state (#3138).
* Removed deprecated classes `Logger` and `AndroidLogger` (#4050).

### Deprecated

* `RealmResults.removeChangeListeners()`. Use `RealmResults.removeAllChangeListeners()` instead.
* `RealmObject.removeChangeListeners()`. Use `RealmObject.removeAllChangeListeners()` instead.
* `RealmResults.distinct()` and `RealmResults.distinctAsync()`. Use `RealmQuery.distinct()` and `RealmQuery.distinctAsync()` instead.

### Enhancements

* Added support for sorting by link's field (#672).
* Added `OrderedRealmCollectionSnapshot` class and `OrderedRealmCollection.createSnapshot()` method. `OrderedRealmCollectionSnapshot` is useful when changing `RealmResults` or `RealmList` in simple loops.
* Added `OrderedRealmCollectionChangeListener` interface for supporting fine-grained collection notifications.
* Added support for ChangeListeners on `RealmList`.
* Added `RealmList.asObservable()`.

### Bug Fixes

* Element type checking in `DynamicRealmObject#setList()` (#4252).
* Now throws `IllegalStateException` instead of process crash when any of thread confined methods in `RealmQuery` is called from wrong thread (#4228).
* Now throws `IllegalStateException` when any of thread confined methods in `DynamicRealmObject` is called from wrong thread (#4258).

### Internal

* Use Object Store's `Results` as the backend for `RealmResults` (#3372).
  - Use Object Store's notification mechanism to trigger listeners.
  - Local commits triggers Realm global listener and `RealmObject` listener on current thread immediately instead of in the next event loop.


## 2.3.2 (2017-02-27)

### Bug fixes

* Log levels in JNI layer were all reported as "Error" (#4204).
* Encrypted realms can end up corrupted if many threads are reading and writing at the same time (#4128).
* "Read-only file system" exception when compacting Realm file on external storage (#4140).

### Internal

* Updated to Realm Sync v1.2.1.

* NPE problem in SharedRealm.finalize() (#3730).
* `RealmList.contains()` and `RealmResults.contains()` now correctly use custom `equals()` method on Realm model classes.
* Build error when the project is using Kotlin (#4087).
* Bug causing classes to be replaced by classes already in Gradle's classpath (#3568).
* NullPointerException when notifying a single object that it changed (#4086).


## 2.3.0 (2017-01-19)

### Object Server API Changes

* Realm Sync v1.0.0 has been released, and Realm Mobile Platform is no longer considered in beta.
* Breaking change: Location of Realm files are now placed in `getFilesDir()/<userIdentifier>` instead of `getFilesDir()/`.
  This is done in order to support shared Realms among users, while each user retaining their own local copy.
* Breaking change: `SyncUser.all()` now returns Map instead of List.
* Breaking change: Added a default `UserStore` saving users in a Realm file (`RealmFileUserStore`).
* Breaking change: Added multi-user support to `UserStore`. Added `get(String)` and `remove(String)`, removed `remove()` and renamed `get()` to `getCurrent()`.
* Breaking change: Changed the order of arguments to `SyncCredentials.custom()` to match iOS: token, provider, userInfo.
* Added support for `PermissionOffer` and `PermissionOfferResponse` to `SyncUser.getManagementRealm()`.
* Exceptions thrown in error handlers are ignored but logged (#3559).
* Removed unused public constants in `SyncConfiguration` (#4047).
* Fixed bug, preventing Sync client to renew the access token (#4038) (#4039).
* Now `SyncUser.logout()` properly revokes tokens (#3639).

### Bug fixes

* Fixed native memory leak setting the value of a primary key (#3993).
* Activated Realm's annotation processor on connectedTest when the project is using kapt (#4008).

* Added temporary work-around for bug crashing Samsung Tab 3 devices on startup (#3651).

### Enhancements

* Added `like` predicate for String fields (#3752).

### Internal

* Updated to Realm Sync v1.0.0.
* Added a Realm backup when receiving a Sync client reset message from the server.

## 2.2.2 (2017-01-16)

### Object Server API Changes (In Beta)

* Disabled `Realm.compactRealm()` when sync is enabled as it might corrupt the Realm (https://github.com/realm/realm-core/issues/2345).

### Bug fixes

* "operation not permitted" issue when creating Realm file on some devices' external storage (#3629).
* Crash on API 10 devices (#3726).
* `UnsatisfiedLinkError` caused by `pipe2` (#3945).
* Unrecoverable error with message "Try again" when the notification fifo is full (#3964).
* Realm migration wasn't triggered when the primary key definition was altered (#3966).
* Use phantom reference to solve the finalize time out issue (#2496).

### Enhancements

* All major public classes are now non-final. This is mostly a compromise to support Mockito. All protected fields/methods are still not considered part of the public API and can change without notice (#3869).
* All Realm instances share a single notification daemon thread.
* Fixed Java lint warnings with generated proxy classes (#2929).

### Internal

* Upgraded Realm Core to 2.3.0.
* Upgraded Realm Sync to 1.0.0-BETA-6.5.

## 2.2.1 (2016-11-12)

### Object Server API Changes (In Beta)

* Fixed `SyncConfiguration.toString()` so it now outputs a correct description instead of an empty string (#3787).

### Bug fixes

* Added version number to the native library, preventing ReLinker from accidentally loading old code (#3775).
* `Realm.getLocalInstanceCount(config)` throwing NullPointerException if called after all Realms have been closed (#3791).

## 2.2.0 (2016-11-12)

### Object Server API Changes (In Beta)

* Added support for `SyncUser.getManagementRealm()` and permission changes.

### Bug fixes

* Kotlin projects no longer create the `RealmDefaultModule` if no Realm model classes are present (#3746).
* Remove `includedescriptorclasses` option from ProGuard rule file in order to support built-in shrinker of Android Gradle Plugin (#3714).
* Unexpected `RealmMigrationNeededException` was thrown when a field was added to synced Realm.

### Enhancements

* Added support for the `annotationProcessor` configuration provided by Android Gradle Plugin 2.2.0 or later. Realm plugin adds its annotation processor to the `annotationProcessor` configuration instead of `apt` configuration if it is available and the `com.neenbedankt.android-apt` plugin is not used. In Kotlin projects, `kapt` is used instead of the `annotationProcessor` configuration (#3026).

## 2.1.1 (2016-10-27)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug in `Realm.insert` and `Realm.insertOrUpdate` methods causing a `StackOverFlow` when you try to insert a cyclic graph of objects between Realms (#3732).

### Object Server API Changes (In Beta)

* Set default RxFactory to `SyncConfiguration`.

### Bug fixes

* ProGuard configuration introduced in 2.1.0 unexpectedly kept classes that did not have the @KeepMember annotation (#3689).

## 2.1.0 (2016-10-25)

### Breaking changes

* * `SecureUserStore` has been moved to its own GitHub repository: https://github.com/realm/realm-android-user-store
  See https://github.com/realm/realm-android-user-store/blob/master/README.md for further info on how to include it.


### Object Server API Changes (In Beta)

* Renamed `User` to `SyncUser`, `Credentials` to `SyncCredentials` and `Session` to `SyncSession` to align names with Cocoa.
* Removed `SyncManager.setLogLevel()`. Use `RealmLog.setLevel()` instead.
* `SyncUser.logout()` now correctly clears `SyncUser.currentUser()` (#3638).
* Missing ProGuard configuration for libraries used by Sync extension (#3596).
* Error handler was not called when sync session failed (#3597).
* Added `User.all()` that returns all known Realm Object Server users.
* Upgraded Realm Sync to 1.0.0-BETA-3.2

### Deprecated

* `Logger`. Use `RealmLogger` instead.
* `AndroidLogger`. The logger for Android is implemented in native code instead.

### Bug fixes

* The following were not kept by ProGuard: names of native methods not in the `io.realm.internal` package, names of classes used in method signature (#3596).
* Permission error when a database file was located on external storage (#3140).
* Memory leak when unsubscribing from a RealmResults/RealmObject RxJava Observable (#3552).

### Enhancements

* `Realm.compactRealm()` now works for encrypted Realms.
* Added `first(E defaultValue)` and `last(E defaultValue)` methods to `RealmList` and `RealmResult`. These methods will return the provided object instead of throwing an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if the list is empty.
* Reduce transformer logger verbosity (#3608).
* `RealmLog.setLevel(int)` for setting the log level across all loggers.

### Internal

* Upgraded Realm Core to 2.1.3

### Credits

* Thanks to Max Furman (@maxfurman) for adding support for `first()` and `last()` default values.

## 2.0.2 (2016-10-06)

This release is not protocol-compatible with previous versions of the Realm Mobile Platform. The base library is still fully compatible.

### Bug fixes

* Build error when using Java 7 (#3563).

### Internal

* Upgraded Realm Core to 2.1.0
* Upgraded Realm Sync to 1.0.0-BETA-2.0.

## 2.0.1 (2016-10-05)

### Bug fixes

* `android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE` broadcast caused `RuntimeException` if sync extension was disabled (#3505).
* `android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE` was not delivered on Android 7 devices.
* `distinctAsync` did not respect other query parameters (#3537).
* `ConcurrentModificationException` from Gradle when building an application (#3501).

### Internal

* Upgraded to Realm Core 2.0.1 / Realm Sync 1.3-BETA

## 2.0.0 (2016-09-27)

This release introduces support for the Realm Mobile Platform!
See <https://realm.io/news/introducing-realm-mobile-platform/> for an overview of these great new features.

### Breaking Changes

* Files written by Realm 2.0 cannot be read by 1.x or earlier versions. Old files can still be opened.
* It is now required to call `Realm.init(Context)` before calling any other Realm API.
* Removed `RealmConfiguration.Builder(Context)`, `RealmConfiguration.Builder(Context, File)` and `RealmConfiguration.Builder(File)` constructors.
* `isValid()` now always returns `true` instead of `false` for unmanaged `RealmObject` and `RealmList`. This puts it in line with the behaviour of the Cocoa and .NET API's (#3101).
* armeabi is not supported anymore.
* Added new `RealmFileException`.
  - `IncompatibleLockFileException` has been removed and replaced by `RealmFileException` with kind `INCOMPATIBLE_LOCK_FILE`.
  - `RealmIOExcpetion` has been removed and replaced by `RealmFileException`.
* `RealmConfiguration.Builder.assetFile(Context, String)` has been renamed to `RealmConfiguration.Builder.assetFile(String)`.
* Object with primary key is now required to define it when the object is created. This means that `Realm.createObject(Class<E>)` and `DynamicRealm.createObject(String)` now throws `RealmException` if they are used to create an object with a primary key field. Use `Realm.createObject(Class<E>, Object)` or `DynamicRealm.createObject(String, Object)` instead.
* Importing from JSON without the primary key field defined in the JSON object now throws `IllegalArgumentException`.
* Now `Realm.beginTransaction()`, `Realm.executeTransaction()` and `Realm.waitForChange()` throw `RealmMigrationNeededException` if a remote process introduces incompatible schema changes (#3409).
* The primary key value of an object can no longer be changed after the object was created. Instead a new object must be created and all fields copied over.
* Now `Realm.createObject(Class)` and `Realm.createObject(Class,Object)` take the values from the model's fields and default constructor. Creating objects through the `DynamicRealm` does not use these values (#777).
* When `Realm.create*FromJson()`s create a new `RealmObject`, now they take the default values defined by the field itself and its default constructor for those fields that are not defined in the JSON object.

### Enhancements

* Added `realmObject.isManaged()`, `RealmObject.isManaged(obj)` and `RealmCollection.isManaged()` (#3101).
* Added `RealmConfiguration.Builder.directory(File)`.
* `RealmLog` has been moved to the public API. It is now possible to control which events Realm emit to Logcat. See the `RealmLog` class for more details.
* Typed `RealmObject`s can now continue to access their fields properly even though the schema was changed while the Realm was open (#3409).
* A `RealmMigrationNeededException` will be thrown with a cause to show the detailed message when a migration is needed and the migration block is not in the `RealmConfiguration`.


### Bug fixes

* Fixed a lint error in proxy classes when the 'minSdkVersion' of user's project is smaller than 11 (#3356).
* Fixed a potential crash when there were lots of async queries waiting in the queue.
* Fixed a bug causing the Realm Transformer to not transform field access in the model's constructors (#3361).
* Fixed a bug causing a build failure when the Realm Transformer adds accessors to a model class that was already transformed in other project (#3469).
* Fixed a bug causing the `NullPointerException` when calling getters/setters in the model's constructors (#2536).

### Internal

* Moved JNI build to CMake.
* Updated Realm Core to 2.0.0.
* Updated ReLinker to 1.2.2.

## 1.2.0 (2016-08-19)

### Bug fixes

* Throw a proper exception when operating on a non-existing field with the dynamic API (#3292).
* `DynamicRealmObject.setList` should only accept `RealmList<DynamicRealmObject>` (#3280).
* `DynamicRealmObject.getX(fieldName)` now throws a proper exception instead of a native crash when called with a field name of the wrong type (#3294).
* Fixed a concurrency crash which might happen when `Realm.executeTransactionAsync()` tried to call `onSucess` after the Realm was closed.

### Enhancements

* Added `RealmQuery.in()` for a comparison against multiple values.
* Added byte array (`byte[]`) support to `RealmQuery`'s `equalTo` and `notEqualTo` methods.
* Optimized internal caching of schema classes (#3315).

### Internal

* Updated Realm Core to 1.5.1.
* Improved sorting speed.
* Completely removed the `OptionalAPITransformer`.

### Credits

* Thanks to Brenden Kromhout (@bkromhout) for adding binary array support to `equalTo` and `notEqualTo`.

## 1.1.1 (2016-07-01)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a wrong JNI method declaration which might cause "method not found" crash on some devices.
* Fixed a bug that `Error` in the background async thread is not forwarded to the caller thread.
* Fixed a crash when an empty `Collection` is passed to `insert()`/`insertOrUpdate()` (#3103).
* Fixed a bug that does not transfer the primary key when `RealmSchemaObject.setClassName()` is called to rename a class (#3118).
* Fixed bug in `Realm.insert` and `Realm.insertOrUpdate` methods causing a `RealmList` to be cleared when inserting a managed `RealmModel` (#3105).
* Fixed a concurrency allocation bug in storage engine which might lead to some random crashes.
* Bulk insertion now throws if it is not called in a transaction (#3173).
* The IllegalStateException thrown when accessing an empty RealmObject is now more meaningful (#3200).
* `insert()` now correctly throws an exception if two different objects have the same primary key (#3212).
* Blackberry Z10 throwing "Function not implemented" (#3178).
* Reduced the number of file descriptors used by Realm Core (#3197).
